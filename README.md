# webtor-php-api-wrapper
PHP Wrapper around webtor.io API

The code is a wrapper for the webtor.io API. It allows you to get the resource id from a magnet link, list the contents of a resource id, export a content from a resource id and get the name of a content from a resource id.

It also has some additional functions that are not part of the API, such as checking whether a torrent contains video content and finding subtitles in a torrent.
